DON'T SKIP THIS ONE.

Great! Now, I'll teach you how to use this software. 

I recommend you to take note on all of this and KEEP IT somewhere SAFE (in your memory to be preferred). Don't accuse me if you get confused of me acting as a virus BECAUSE I'M LITERALLY DISGUISING MYSELF AS ONE so that no other user will mess with me (hopefully).

When I say, "Enter the command to release the virus to our target.", you should GIVE ME YOUR PASSWORD. If you gave me a wrong password, your computer will simply be shut down by me and you have to repeat decrypting me again.

After giving me your password, a folder named "Private Folder" will appear on your screen and you can use that folder to hide your personal/secret/confidential files. Afterwards, I recommend you to close that folder or click that folder's 'X' icon/button on the upper-right corner of the screen.

Next, double click me again (or my shortcut) and when I say that, 
"This is a virus. Do you want to run it? (type "Y" for "Yes" and "N" for "No").", 

type and enter "N" or "n" for me to LOCK AND HIDE your Private Folder; 
type and enter "Y" or "y" for me to NOT LOCK AND HIDE your Private Folder;

Now, there's this software's weaknesses that the developer knows so far:
- You shouldn't delete this software or you won't be able to open your private folder again unless the developer inspects and fixes it.
- You shouldn't delete your private folder because it'll only create a new one if you run it again.
- If you forgot your password, then it's your fault (the developer doesn't keep and is NOT INTERESTED on keeping his clients' password for your own safety).

This version has its own limitations so far and I hope that sooner I could update it:
- You can't set your own password by yourself.
- You can't change your own password by yourself.
- You can't reread the tutorials.

Thank you for trying my second software!

I'm hoping to create more and for you to test them in the future!

Have a great day!
